          <h3 id="by-using-the-redvid-app-you-agree-to-the-privacy-policy-given-here">This policy applies CPT Consulting</h3>
          <p>CPT Consulting acknowledges the importance of your privacy and is devoted to protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the personal information you provide.</p>
          <p>In this Privacy Policy, we elaborate on how CPT Consulting manages and safeguards your personal information regarding the hosting of this website and the provision of diverse business advisory services across various sectors like corporate finance, restructuring, economic and financial consulting, forensic and litigation consulting, health solutions, strategic communications, and technology ("Services")</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="information-collection-and-use">Notice at Collection</h3>
          <p>CPT Consulting gathers personal information as described below for specific purposes and timeframes. We do not sell or disclose your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising ("sharing"), nor do we acquire or process sensitive personal information to deduce traits about you. If you provide CPT Consulting with personal information about others, you are accountable for informing them.</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="log-data">Scope of this policy</h3>
          <p>
            This policy pertains to personal information collected and/or used by CPT as a controller as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and analogous laws (e.g., Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, the DIFC Data Protection Law 2020, etc.). California residents should also refer to the section of this policy concerning their rights. Details about when we collect personal information are outlined under "When do we collect personal information" below.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            When providing Services to clients, we sometimes manage personal information as a processor (e.g., hosting client data on our e-discovery platforms). This implies that we process the information solely on our clients' instructions, who retain control of the information.

          </p>
          <p>Therefore, if our utilization of your personal information isn't addressed in this policy, you may need to contact the client (and controller) responsible for processing your information.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of these Privacy Practices, “Personal information” refers to information related to an identified or identifiable individual or reasonably capable of being associated with, or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific individual or household.</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="cookies">Cookie Policy</h3>
          <p>
            CPT Consulting is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information and being transparent about the technologies utilized. This Cookie Policy elucidates how and why cookies and similar technologies are employed by CPT to enhance your user experience on our websites.
            </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="security">Information Security</h3>
          <p>
            CPT has instituted practical technical safeguards, security policies, and procedures to ensure the protection of personal information from unauthorized loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. This includes enforcing confidentiality obligations on our staff and service providers, restricting access to your personal information as required, and providing appropriate training to our personnel. Moreover, we maintain thorough data incident response protocols and subject our IT Security Program to regular audits.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Performing Services for Our Clients</h3>
          <p>
            CPT retains your personal information for the duration required for the purposes it was collected, any compatible purposes established subsequently, or any new purposes to which you subsequently consent, or to comply with legal, regulatory, and CPT policy requirements. This period usually aligns with the period of your, or the relevant client's, relationship or contract with CPT, plus a period reflecting the length of time for which legal claims may arise following the termination of such relationship or contract. Some information (e.g., call recordings, tax records, and certain data demonstrating regulatory compliance) may need to be retained for longer periods. Personal information may be kept for shorter or longer durations if required by law or CPT policy, if subject to a legal hold (e.g., following communication from our regulator), or if identified through a data protection impact assessment that a different retention period is suitable.</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="links-to-other-sites">Retention of your personal information</h3>
          <p>
            CPT retains your personal information for the period of time required for the purposes for which it was collected, any compatible purposes which we subsequently establish, or any new purposes to which you subsequently consent, or to comply with legal, regulatory and CPT policy requirements. This period of time will usually be the period of your, or the relevant client's, relationship or contract with CPT plus a period reflecting the length of time for which legal claims may be made following the termination of such relationship or contract. Some information (such as call recordings, tax records and certain information required to demonstrate regulatory compliance) may need to be kept for longer. Personal information will be kept for a shorter or longer period of time if so required by law or an CPT policy, if the information becomes subject to a legal hold (for example, following a communication from our regulator) or if we have identified through a data protection impact assessment that a different retention period is appropriate.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="childrens-privacy">Children`s Privacy</h3>
          <p>CPT`s websites are not intentionally designed for or directed at children under the age of 16. It is CPT’s policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 16, except as part of an engagement to provide professional services.</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Policy</h3>
          <p>
            By using CPT websites you consent to the collection, use and storage of personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the websites. CPT reserves the right to make changes to this Website Privacy Policy from time to time. CPT will notify you by posting amendments to the Privacy Policy on this website.
